# Prob-in-Ctrl
This repository contains a collection of programs written by team *Probably in Control* (part of the Summer 2018 HEATlab group). 
These files were migrated from the repository for Robotbrunch, and earlier group in HEATlab.
The programs here serve to
- generate STNUs, both randomly and from provided PSTN datasets
- compute metrics related to controllability on STNUs
- simulate dispatch on STNUs


## (Lack of) Documentation
Currently, no doxygen.config file exists in this repository.
However, the files are commented so that doxygen documentation can be automatically generated once a config and mainpage files are set up.
